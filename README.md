# Sophon SDK

The Sophon SDK provides tools and interfaces to integrate Sophon Global Wallet into your applications. This SDK is designed to work with modern web applications and follows Ethereum standards for wallet integration.

## Receiving a Partner ID

Local development does not require a separate partner ID, you can use the default one `123b216c-678e-4611-af9a-2d5b7b061258`. For production, you will need to receive a partner ID from us. Please reach out to us to get a partner ID via dropping a mail to [product@sophon.xyz](mailto:product@sophon.xyz).

## Motivation

The Sophon SDK addresses several key challenges in blockchain application development:

1. **Seamless Wallet Integration**: Provides a standardized way to integrate with the Sophon Account without complex configuration
2. **EIP Standards Compliance**: Follows Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) to ensure compatibility with the ecosystem
3. **Multi-Wallet Support**: Implements [EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963) for better multi-wallet discovery and interaction
4. **Developer Experience**: Simplifies the wallet connection process to let developers focus on building their applications

## Packages

The SDK is organized into a bunch of packages you are free to explore but these are the most important ones:

### @sophon-labs/account-connector

Core wallet functionality that implements the Ethereum Provider API ([EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963)). This package provides the basic wallet interface for interacting with the Sophon ecosystem.

### @sophon-labs/account-eip6963

Implementation of the [EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963) standard (Multi Injected Provider Discovery) for Sophon Account. This enables applications to discover the Sophon Account alongside other wallets in a standardized way.

This is your good-to-go package if you are building web experiences.

### @sophon-labs/account-react-native

Implementation of the bridge between your smart wallet and our Account Server, with this you can add support to the Sophon Account in your react native wallet without having to relay on external apps or other integrations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20+)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

To integrate the Sophon Account with [EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963) support in your project:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @sophon-labs/account-eip6963

# Using yarn
yarn add @sophon-labs/account-eip6963
```

## Using the EIP-6963 Package

EIP-6963 is a standard that allows multiple Ethereum wallet providers to be discovered on a web page without conflicting with each other, unlike the traditional `window.ethereum` approach.

### Basic Integration

1. Import and initialize the EIP-6963 emitter in your application entry point:

If you are statically using testnet

```javascript
import "@sophon-labs/account-eip6963/testnet";

// The Sophon Account will now announce itself via the EIP-6963 protocol
// No additional setup is required
```

Otherwise, if you are statically using mainnet

```javascript
import "@sophon-labs/account-eip6963/mainnet";

// The Sophon Account will now announce itself via the EIP-6963 protocol
// No additional setup is required
```

If you prefer a more dynamic way

```javascript
import { createSophonEIP6963Emitter } from "@sophon-labs/account-eip6963";
createSophonEIP6963Emitter(process.env.NETWORK_KEY);

// The Sophon Account will now announce itself via the EIP-6963 protocol
// No additional setup is required
```

This will automatically:

- Register the Sophon Account provider
- Announce it through the [EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963) events
- Make it available to [EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963) compatible applications

### Working with Wallet Connection Libraries

Most modern wallet connection libraries, like RainbowKit, wagmi, or Reown Appkit, support [EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963). Here's how to connect with wagmi:

```javascript
import { getDefaultConfig } from "@rainbow-me/rainbowkit";
import { sophonTestnet, sophon } from "wagmi/chains";
import { createSophonEIP6963Emitter } from "@sophon-labs/account-eip6963";

createSophonEIP6963Emitter("testnet");

export const config = getDefaultConfig({
  appName: "Your Application",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  chains: [sophon, sophonTestnet],
  ssr: true,
});
```

With this setup, the Sophon Account will appear in the wallet selection UI provided by RainbowKit.

## Technical Details

### EIP-1193 Compliance

The Sophon Account implements the Ethereum Provider JavaScript API ([EIP-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193)), which defines a standard interface for Ethereum providers. This ensures compatibility with existing tools and libraries in the Ethereum ecosystem.

### EIP-6963 Implementation

The `@sophon-labs/account-eip6963` package implements the Multi Injected Provider Discovery [specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963), which:

1. Announces the Sophon Account provider through window events
2. Provides wallet metadata (name, icon, RDNS identifier)
3. Returns a compliant EIP-1193 provider interface
4. Responds to provider discovery requests

## Examples

See the `examples/sandbox-eip6963` directory for a complete example of integrating the `Sophon Account` with `ConnectKit` and `wagmi`.
