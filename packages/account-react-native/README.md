# @sophon-labs/account-react-native

Library to handle sophon account on react native environments

## Installation

Before you start, you need these libraries:

```sh
# Expo packages
npx expo install react-native-webview expo-standard-web-crypto expo-crypto expo-network expo-secure-store @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

After that, you are ready to install our SDK:

```sh
# Sophon Library
npm install @sophon-labs/account-react-native
```

## Usage

Before anything, you need to wrap your application with `SophonContextProvider`, that will store context information about the accoint and walletClient connection.

```ts
import { SophonContextProvider } from "@sophon-labs/account-react-native";

export default function RootLayout() {
  // ...

  return <SophonContextProvider network="testnet">{/* Your components*/}</SophonContextProvider>;
}
```

With that ready, you can now use our hooks to interact with Sophon.

```ts
import { useSophonAccount } from "@sophon-labs/account-react-native";

export default function YourComponent() {
  const { connect, account } = useSophonAccount();
  // ...
}
```
